# IPL-Player-Form-Generator
Since the IPL season was going on and due to this pandemic period everybody is at home so, we decided to make something on the current scenarios. 
As we may have seen, many applications are present in which users select a team comprising of players from both the teams that are playing in a match. 
The problem here is that people don't know how good is a player is performing in the last 5-6 matches. If users somehow get the feature, which can show 
a cricket player's recent batting or bowling form, then it may help them to select a better team and increase their chances of winning. We are doing this
in our app called “IPL Player Form Generator” using Regular Expression (or Regex) in which there is a squad of each IPL team and each player's form according to
the last 5 matches is shown. The form is divided into 5 sections ranging from very poor to great for both batting and bowling.
